# Mfon
A simple shopping cart application written in C#.

## Features
- The application allows users to select products from a list of products.
- The application allows users to add products to their cart.
- The application allows users to enter their budget.
- The application determines if the total cost of the products in the users cart is below or above their budget.
- The application prints out a message saying if the cart items are below or above the budget and then says goodbye.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Press F5 to run the application.
4. Follow the prompts to select products, add them to your cart, enter your budget, and see the result.

## How it works
The application uses a `Cart` class to keep track of the products in the users cart. The `Cart` class contains a list of `Product` objects, which are added to the cart when the user selects a product. The application also uses a `Program` class to contain the main entry point for the application. The `Program` class is responsible for prompting the user for input, adding products to the cart, and determining if the total cost of the products in the cart is below or above the users budget.
